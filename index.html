The man follows a number of celebrities who have also been arrested and bailed under suspicion of sex offences, Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr and Max Mosley have all been questioned by police. 

So far, some 589 people have come forward with information relating to the scandal, with 450 of them alleging they were sexually abused by former Top of the Pops presenter Savile. Of those making complaints about the late DJ, 73% were children at the time of the offences.

A report released last month revealed that Savile's victims included an eight-year-old boy and children who were seriously ill.
